wpManySiteAdmin
===========

Scripts for simplified installation, update, monitoring and deletion of Wordpress sites. Each site is after installation automatically upgraded through minor updates and scanned for vulnerabilities using wp-scan and ssl-labs-scan.

Note: The default installation installs the Active Directory (AD) plugin for Wordpress since AD is commonly used at LiU for user data. This readme does NOT cover AD-plugin configuration since that's specific to each domain.
